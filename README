<b><u>1. Have you ever failed an exam? What were the reasons for failing?</b></u><br>
Yes, a lot back then in High School. I didn't review when I got the chance. I also didn't listen to the teacher that's why I did not understand the lesson.<br>
<br>
<b><u>2. For those who haven't failed an exam, what was you highest score in an exam? What do you think made you reach the top?</u></b><br>
I can't answer this because I have failed before.<br>
<br>
<b><u>3. How was your first CSB Midterm examination? Knowing what you know now, what would have you done differently? What are you going to do in CSB Finals?</u></b><br>
My first CSB Midterm examination was way too different from exams back then when I was in High School. It was not that stressful compared to exams in High school, and the schedule is different. In High school, my school usually have 4 consecutive days of examination, but here in College exams will depend on the mood of the professor. Also it is not very stressful, because in College not all subjects have exam on one day. You will have a lot of time to review and focus more on that subject but in High School, you don't know were to start. Which subject you will study first, what topic, etc. Before Midterms, I just read my notes and recap the lessons of the prof. In preparing for the CSB Finals, I think I will listen more to the prof and write important details of the lesson. <br>
